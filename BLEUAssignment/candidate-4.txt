Four Sons Torah speaks . One wise , one wicked , one over , and one does not know to ask .
Wise what he says ? What evidence and the statutes and ordinances which Yi our God commanded you ? And you told him the laws of Passover : No Mftirin another Passover offering .
Evil what he says ? What keep this service to you ? You - not him . And according removes himself from the rule mainly village . And you blunt his teeth and said it did for me when I left Egypt Yi . Me - not him . Had there not been redeemed .
Over what he says ? What is it ? And told him : strength of hand the Yi brought us out of Egypt , the house of bondage .
And he does not know to ask - you open it , it says : tell your son on that day , saying it did for me when I left Egypt Yi .
