The Torah speaks of four children : One is wise , one is wicked , one is simple and one does not know how to ask .
The wise one , what does he say ? What are the testimonies , the statutes and the laws which the L-rd , our Gâ€‘d , has commanded you ? You , in turn , shall instruct him in the laws of Passover , [up to] one is not to eat any dessert after the Passover-lamb .
The wicked one , what does he say ? What is this service to you ?! He says to you , but not to him ! By thus excluding himself from the community he has denied that which is fundamental . You , therefore , blunt his teeth and say to him : It is because of this that the L-rd did for me when I left Egypt ; for me - but not for him ! If he had been there , he would not have been redeemed !
The simpleton , what does he say ? What is this ? Thus you shall say to him : With a strong hand the L-rd took us out of Egypt , from the house of slaves .
As for the one who does not know how to ask , you must initiate him , as it is said : You shall tell your child on that day , It is because of this that the L-rd did for me when I left Egypt .
