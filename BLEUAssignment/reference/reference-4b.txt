The Torah speaks of four types of children : one is wise , one is wicked , one is simple , and one does not know how to ask .
The Wise One asks : What is the meaning of the laws and traditions G-d has commanded ? You should teach him all the traditions of Passover , even to the last detail .
The Wicked One asks : What does this ritual mean to you ? By using the expression to you he excludes himself from his people and denies G-d . Shake his arrogance and say to him : It is because of what the L-rd did for me when I came out of Egypt ... For me and not for him -- for had he been in Egypt , he would not have been freed .
The Simple One asks : What is all this ? You should tell him : It was with a mighty hand that the L-rd took us out of Egypt , out of the house of bondage .
As for the One Who Does Not Know How To Ask , you should open the discussion for him , as it is written : And you shall explain to your child on that day , It is because of what the L-rd did for me when I came out of Egypt .
